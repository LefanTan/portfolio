# Lefan's Portfolio website

This app is made with just react. I've learned a lot trying different stuff when making this website.

Couple things I learned is the different animation library for react, mainly React Spring and Framer motion which I liked a lot more.
I've also tried arrange my website in a way that pans and scrolls horizontally, but I ran into a lot of scaling issues myself and it's just way to much hassle.

## Key Takeaways

Again, this portfolio website was rushed (made in 2 weeks since school is starting), I wanted to have a platform to showcase my work but I'm personally not a fan of the UI design, interaction design etc. 

1. Tailwind is great, but I'm not using it correctly (@layer). Plus using just CSS helps me learn better
2. No more horizontal scrolling (for now?)
3. Responsive design for this website is not awful, but not great at all by any means. I should research/figure out better css layout design that are more responsive.
4. Use more Semantic HTMLs
5. Better accessbility with ARIA
6. It would be better if the website is linked to a backend server deployed on a cloud instance (currently in works with a new version of my portfolio website)
    - so that I can easily change/update information without having to change react code and deploy them to github pages
    - reflects how a real world application works 
    - opportunity to learn!
