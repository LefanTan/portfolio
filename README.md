This app is made with just react. I've learned a lot trying different stuff when making this website.

Couple things I learned is the different animation library for react, mainly React Spring and Framer motion which I liked a lot more.
I've also tried arrange my website in a way that pans and scrolls horizontally, but I ran into a lot of scaling issues myself and it's just way to much hassle.
